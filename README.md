# ShapeClassifierPyTorch

A lightweight shape classification project built with PyTorch, designed to identify basic geometric shapes such as circles, squares, and triangles from image data.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Synthetic shape image generation
- CNN-based classification model
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Visualization of predictions

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Winston-Ch/ShapeClassifierPyTorch.git
cd ShapeClassifierPyTorch
python train.py
```

## ðŸ§  Model Overview
The model uses a simple convolutional neural network to classify images of geometric shapes. Training data is synthetically generated to simulate various shapes with noise and variation.

## ðŸ“Š Results
Achieves high accuracy on synthetic shape data with clear visualizations of predictions.
